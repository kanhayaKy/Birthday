          </div>
          <div class="date">2020</div>
          <p>the story of muskan and fareeha is the story of two girls growing up and coming of age together.

enemies to friends in kindergarten- rashi, you, and i had a 2 vs 1 rivalry going on. but you and i sealed the deal when you told me she had lice in her hair because she was hindu. from then on we stayed away from her. prejudice brought us together.

we saw each other at weddings in the hand wash area and said hi. always said hi. <br><br>

in fifth grade you invited me to your birthday hangout in Central because you were my best friend‚Äôs friend and i was your best friend‚Äôs friend. i knew we‚Äôd formed ourselves a little friend group then. <br><br/>

in eighth grade when they split our group up, i was relieved to know you and i would be together. i didn‚Äôt even scan the room to look for potential friends on the first day- you were enough. <br><br><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

once in chemistry class, anupama ma‚Äôam pronounced ‚Äúcircuit‚Äù weird. i reached across and wrote ‚Äúsir cute‚Äù on your notebook. we laughed uncontrollably and snorted (in the first bench) and she shouted at you. we did it again.<br><br>

you made new friends and i did too, and we formed a new group, coming together in a way only best friends‚Äô friends can. <br><br />

i made you read harry potter. no, really, i made you. i handed you my book and sat next to you and glared at you as you read. we couldn‚Äôt believe your mom had met daniel radcliffe, without knowing you were a fan. <br><br>

we sat next to each other in class and talked all day. then you walked to your bus, i walked home, and we picked up our conversation on our phones until you got home. and then, you‚Äôd call me again at night. <br><br>

in ninth grade i found myself separated from the group. i looked around my class and saw cliques and already formed groups. i didn‚Äôt care, i knew i‚Äôd see you at lunch and that was enough for me. except, we never had enough time did we? <br /><br>

one day on our call you told me about a lame movie you‚Äôd watched only because dylan o‚Äôbrien was in it. you described it start to finish in all its boring detail. ‚Äúwhat was the point of that?‚Äù i asked. ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm just telling you.‚Äù we just told each other things. <br><br>

when dylan got injured, we stayed up all night waiting for updates and sending each other gifs of him laughing or smiling. you tweeted something about it and we celebrated the (small) number of retweets. <br><br>

in tenth grade, when i told my class friends that i was moving away, siddharth asked, ‚Äúdid you tell muskan?‚Äù because he knew, too. everyone knew about me and you and what we had. <br><br>

one night i texted you sobbing about moving away. ‚Äúi‚Äôll never find another best friend like you‚Äù i said. and i haven‚Äôt. because i still have you.<br><br>

we had to go our separate ways, but i still wake up to your texts and think of you at the thought of harry potter. when i talk about you i say ‚Äúmy best friend back home...‚Äù you are still my best friend and you are still home.<br><br>

our origin stories are inexorably intertwined. i just hope and pray that the ends of our character arcs will be, too.</span></p><br>

          <p> Hey‚ù§Ô∏è Happy Birthday Muskan‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for everything you've ever done for me. I love you so much. And I can't tell you how bad I miss you:( I miss school and just simply sitting next to you. Not saying anything, just your company is enough for my sadness to go away. Hopefully I'll get to see you soon. And I can say more stupid things like the ostrich brain. And I hope you know, I'm here for you always. Happy Birthday again, fatty‚ù§Ô∏è I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>

          <p>As I've said before and as everyone knows, I don't interact a lot with people so you are lucky that I talk to you. üòÇ<br>

We might not be in the same class now on and honestly, I'm really happy that the fights between you and Srii won't disturb me. üòÇ<br>
You talk and laugh a lot, and your jokes are silly, yet better than Srii's.ü§£

All of this aside, on a serious note you come across as a genuine person which is very rare these days and I appreciate that and also the fact that you stand by what you think and sometimes listen to the unrelated stuff I talk about.üòÇ<br>

So thanks for being there it wasn't really the first year in college anyone of us expected but let's appreciate that we still have 3 more years together.<br>
And I can assure you that I'll be more than happy to help with anything and everything in my capacity.<br>

Wishing you a a very Happy Birthday and a blessed year ahead. Stay happy and stay the way you are.<br>

May Allah bless! üòá</p>
